	<h1>Introduction to exceptions in JavaScript</h1>
</div>				<div data-p="cont/pane">
<p>
	Now we will look at exceptional situations 
	in JavaScript. To begin with, I will make 
	some introduction, in which there will be 
	examples of exceptional situations in 
	general for any programming language, 
	and then we will figure out how things 
	are in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
	When we write our programs, we implicitly 
	rely on the fact that all the software 
	and hardware mechanisms we use will work 
	correctly.
</p>
<p>
	This, however, is not always the case. When 
	data is transmitted over the network, 
	the connection is interrupted and the 
	data comes to us in an incorrect form, 
	or doesn't come at all. When writing a 
	file, it turns out that the space 
	allocated to us on the hard disk has 
	run out, and the file cannot be written. 
	When reading a file, it turns out that 
	such a file doesn't exist and we have 
	nowhere to read from. When printing 
	data on the printer, the cable between 
	the printer and the computer breaks.
</p>
<p>
	All the described situations have a 
	common essence: a certain failure occurs, 
	which leads to the impossibility or 
	senselessness of completing the 
	planned operation.
</p>
<p>
	There are also situations in which some 
	kind of error occurs that is not a 
	failure. For example, you ask the user 
	for his email, and he enters the email 
	in an incorrect format. It is clear 
	that our program cannot continue to 
	process email, as it is not correct. 
	However, this is not an exceptional 
	situation. Our program can correct 
	the situation itself: it will display 
	an error message and the user will 
	repeat his input.
</p>
<p>
	In fact, the difference between 
	failing and not failing is quite 
	vague. An event that one program 
	might treat as an exception may be 
	treated by another program as some 
	kind of error that it can handle.
</p>
<p>
	The criterion here is the following: if, 
	when a problem occurs, your program 
	can continue to do what it is intended 
	for, then this is not an exception, 
	and if it cannot, then yes, this is 
	an exception.
</p>
<p>
	For example, we have a program that 
	needs to ask the user's email address. If 
	the user entered an email in the wrong 
	format, this is not a failure. This is 
	an expected problem and our program 
	will ask the user for an email many 
	times until he enters it correctly.
</p>
<p>
	Suppose our program that asks for email 
	should also send that valid email over 
	the Internet. It turns out that the 
	Internet is not working. This is already 
	a problem: the program will not be able 
	to send data over the Internet if the 
	Internet is down. The program, however, 
	can continue its execution: it can 
	display information about the problem, 
	retry sending after a while, and so on. 
	But these actions are not quite what 
	the program was intended for, since 
	the program cannot do the main 
	action - sending an email.
</p>
<p>
	Very often, whether an exception occurs 
	or not depends on the programming 
	language. In many languages, if suddenly 
	a division by zero occurs, this is 
	considered an exception (since you 
	cannot divide by zero), but in 
	JavaScript it is not considered 
	(in JavaScript, you can divide by zero).
